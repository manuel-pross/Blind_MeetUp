   "firstText": "This web application offers the possibility to easily and anonymously register for meetings at different Furtwangen locations. With this we want to promote trans-faculty communication at Furtwangen University, as we find that most faculties tend to be fairly insular. This is an opportunity for students and internationals to meet new people and participate in campus live.",
   "secText": "We lower barriers to communication and promote university-wide exchange. New contacts and good communication, free from prejudice are important motivating factors for students. This allows students to expand their personal network and make friends more easily. Blind MeetUp provides participants with joy and variety during their everyday studies."
